When I saw the new project dialog for Windows Store Apps or Windows 8 Apps, I had a problem. What is   the difference between a Class Library project vs. Windows Runtime Component project.




Fortunately, Pavel wrote a nice article about this, you can read his article at [http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/pavely](http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/pavely/archive/2012/10/30/windows-8-store-apps-class-library-vs-windows-runtime-component.aspx)
