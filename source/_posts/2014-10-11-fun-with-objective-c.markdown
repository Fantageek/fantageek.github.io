I really love that moment when people try to use Objective C to imitate features of other languages or to make some cool tricks. It is a chance for you to learn more about Objective C



## [Statically typed Objective-C collections](https://github.com/iMartinKiss/Typed)





>
  Do you like typed arrays in Swift (or other languages)? Would you like to have them in Objective-C? Now you can.






## ["Currying" Objective-C Methods](http://blog.lukhnos.org/post/17270947434/currying-objective-c-methods)





>
  In this blog post, I’ll show you a way to “curry” Objective-C methods. I’ll first talk about the problem I’m trying to solve, what currying is, and how currying can help solve the problem






## [Switching on Objects in Objective-C](http://www.dudas.co.uk/switching-on-objects-in-objective-c/)





>
  A simple way to implement object based switch-like statements in Objective-C using blocks. Any object that conforms to NSCopying can be used to switched on.






## [OCUDL](http://dbachrach.com/posts/ocudl-in-depth/)





>
  OCUDL is an experiment to bring user defined literals to Objective-C. A literal is a shorthand expression that creates a value of a certain type. For example, 25ul creates an unsigned long of 25, and @"hello" creates an NSString of hello. User defined literals bring this brevity and expressivity to our own types.






## [A pattern to switch on an object's value](http://blog.vikingosegundo.de/2012/10/05/pattern-switch-value-object/)





>
  I want to show, how we can achieve switching on a block with a similar two-closure approach — or in Objective-C: two-block approach.






## [FTGShorthand](https://github.com/onmyway133/FTGShorthand)





>
  Allows your category methods to be in shorthand form, like MagicalRecord MR_SHORTHAND
