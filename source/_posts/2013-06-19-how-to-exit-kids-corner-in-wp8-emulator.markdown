What will you do with the new Visual Studio 2012 and Windows Phone 8 SDK? Definitely is to create a sample project and see what happens on the emulator screen, playing around discovering stuffs there.




You will find the Kid's Corner, enter it but can't find the way to exit. Simply because there no Power button on the WP8 emulator.




The solution is to press F12 on your keyboard, it simulates the Power button :)

And, it would be nice if you can remember   some useful hot keys when playing with Windows Phone 8 emulator. See [Keyboard mapping](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/ff754352(v=vs.105).aspx)
