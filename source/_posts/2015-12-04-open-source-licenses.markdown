Swift is open source, here at [swift](https://github.com/apple/swift) and [Swift.org](https://swift.org/). And for now it uses [Apache license](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

There is a joke on this pull request [I think we should use GPL v3 instead, it's the future of open source.](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/17)

When developing iOS apps, most of the libraries I use are on MIT licenses, a permissive license, which is good :]

MIT vs GPL vs Apache

These have many things in common

- Commercial Use: This software and derivatives may be used for commercial purposes.
- Distribution: You may distribute this software.
- Modification: This software may be modified.
- Private use: You may use and modify the software without distributing it.
- License and copyright notice: Include a copy of the license and copyright notice with the code.

GPL is Disclose Source: copyleft license that requires anyone who distributes your code or a derivative work to make the source available under the same terms.

Apache is Patent Grant and State Changes: Indicate significant changes made to the code

MIT is simple, permissive. You can do anything you like
