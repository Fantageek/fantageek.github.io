Before computers existed, Alan Turing invented a type of theoretical machine now called a Turing Machine, which formalized what it means to compute a number




Eric Grimson once said "With six primitives, I can rule the world. With six primitives, I can program anything". They are the basic of Turing Machine and are composed of




**Right**: Move the Machine's head to the right of the current square  

**Left**: Move the Machine's head to the left of the current square  

**Print**: Print a symbol on the current square  

**Scan**: Identify any symbols on the current square  

**Erase**: Erase any symbols presented o the current square  

**Nothing**: Do nothing
