I read in [an article](http://blog.penso.info/2013/05/25/getting-a-job-in-san-francisco/) that "Working in fashion? Go to NYC. Working in Software development? Go to SF. Itâ€™s just that simple.". By SF or other high tech scene places, I mean we can have opportunities to learn in the best universities, work with the best people, meet new friends in local meet ups, conferences, ...

I see questions on Quora a lot on how to relocate to work in those companies, how to have eligible visa to attend bootcamp, conferences, ...

But think for a while now, we already have access to all these things by other means, to a certain degree even if we 're not in the Bay Area. All we need is the the right attitude. So be positive and do [effortful study](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ultimate-code-kata/). The world is more likely to be flat now





  * University: We can learn course from [edX](https://www.edx.org), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com), ...

  * Projects: We can learn and contribute to open source projects. Some companies like [Artsy](http://www.objc.io/issue-22/artsy.html) have "Open Source By default" in mind, and we can learn much from their work


  * Blog: Popular developers have blog. You can learn a lot by reading their blogs. [What are the most popular software developer blogs/news sources?](http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-popular-software-developer-blogs-news-sources)


  * Trend: Twitter is a good source for learning new trends in the community. And following popular people cost you zero
