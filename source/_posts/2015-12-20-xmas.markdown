Christmas is when we I have the most special feeling. The cool air, the snow, the reunion, the church bell ringing, ...

It 's beginning to look a lot like Christmas. First with Xcode

[Xmas](https://github.com/onmyway133/xmas) is an Xcode plugin that shows Xmas picture along with wishing message whenever a build succeeds

How it works
--

### Swift
- Try to do much of the job in Swift as possible

### DVTKit
- Xcode uses `DVTBezelAlertPanel` to display alert. So we swizzle its `initWithIcon:message:parentWindow:duration:`
- `DVTBezelAlertPanel` is from `DVTKit`. I thought about importing [run time header](https://github.com/luisobo/Xcode-RuntimeHeaders) and just `extension` it. But I find swizzling in Objective C a much more easier solution

### NSVisualEffectView
- It seems that `NSImage` added to the panel 's `NSVisualEffectView` had it `template` set to YES again, hence causing the image into template color with the panel background color
- This happens in the `init` method. So we must change `template` back to NO after `init` happens

```objc
- (id)xmas_initWithIcon:(id)icon
                message:(NSString *)message
           parentWindow:(id)parentWindow
               duration:(double)duration {
        [self xmas_initWithIcon:image message:gift.message parentWindow:parentWindow duration:duration];

        image.template = NO;

        return self;
}
```

And, Merry Christmas to you and your family
