My Windows 8 today has very weird behavior with the keyboard. When I type " (double quote) it does not show up. It does show up until I type another key.




The solution is to choose the US keyboard. Look for Language preference in the bottom right taskbar of your screen, or press Windows + Backspace.

**The permanent solution**  

If the problem still exists, go to _Control Panel -> Clock, Language and Region -> Language -> Add languages_  

Install English (United States) and remove English (United Kingdom)
