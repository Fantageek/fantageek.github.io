Quoted from Warren Buffet in his live stream video during an "Office Hours" session with Levo League




Forgot about the pay




<blockquote>Never give up searching for the job that you’re passionate about," he says. "Try to find the job you’d have if you were independently rich. ... Forget about the pay. When you’re associating with the people that you love, doing what you love, it doesn’t get any better than that

Don't work for someone who won't pay you fairly




<blockquote>I do very little negotiation with people. And they do little with me, in terms of it ... if I was a woman and I thought I was getting paid considerably less than somebody else that was equal coming in, that would bother me a lot. I probably wouldn't even want to work there.  I mean, if somebody's gonna be unfair with you, in   salary, they're probably being unfair with you in a hundred other ways
