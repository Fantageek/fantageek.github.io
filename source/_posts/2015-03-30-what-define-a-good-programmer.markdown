I always found myself asking this question "What define a good programmer?"

I ask lots of people and the answers vary, they 're all correct for certain aspects



<blockquote>
  Good programmer is someone who has a solid knowledge of the "how-to" both in theory and in practices. Understanding customer requirements clearly and having a vision to fulfill it through dedication and execution !
  
  Good programmer is one who has in depth knowledge of one particular major and wide understanding of many thing else
  
  Algorithm (actually this is my definition)
</blockquote>



But I think I find the answer now, it is "responsibility".

Thanks Uncle Bob for pointing it out in his experience sharing "The Professional Programmer" in the book [97 Things Every Programmer Should Know: Collective Wisdom from the Experts](http://www.amazon.com/Things-Every-Programmer-Should-Know/dp/0596809484)



<blockquote>
  The single most important trait of a professional programmer is personal responsibility. Professional programmers take responsibility for their career, their estimates, their schedule commitments, their mistakes, and their work- manship. A professional programmer does not pass that responsibility off on others.
</blockquote>







  * If you are a professional, then you are responsible for your own career


  * Professionals take responsibility for the code they write


  * Professionals are team players


  * Professionals do not tolerate big bug lists


  * Professionals do not make a mess



Although he talks about professional programmer, but my intention in "good programmer" term is the same as that
