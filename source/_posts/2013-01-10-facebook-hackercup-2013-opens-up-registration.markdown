Facebook Hacker Cup is an international programming competition hosted and administered by Facebook. The competition began in 2011 as a means to identify top engineering talent for potential employment at Facebook.

The competition consists of a set of algorithmic problems which must be solved in a fixed amount of time. Competitors may use any programming language and development environment to obtain their solutions.




The worldwide programming competition kicks off with an online qualification round from Jan. 25-27, when hackers compete against each other "for fame, fortune, glory and a shot at the title of world champion," the Hacker Cup Facebook page said.




Those who have registered for previous years' competitions are automatically added to the 2013 round but Facebook encourages users to make sure all personal information is up-to-date.
