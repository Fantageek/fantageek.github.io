It is pretty much this

> 1. You're not to think you are anything special.
2. You're not to think you are as good as we are.
3. You're not to think you are smarter than we are.
4. You're not to convince yourself that you are better than we are.
5. You're not to think you know more than we do.
6. You're not to think you are more important than we are.
7. You're not to think you are good at anything.
8. You're not to laugh at us.
9. You're not to think anyone cares about you.
10. You're not to think you can teach us anything.

There are many discussions about this

Putting on your black hat, it sounds negative. Putting on your yellow hat, it sounds positive

But what I learn about it is the team work. No one lives alone, everyone lives among the others. It is about to be humble and learn collaboration
