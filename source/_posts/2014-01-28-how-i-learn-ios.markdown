#### Preface


I came to iOS late, when its iOS version was 7. I decided to go professional with iOS in late 2013. Actually I knew of iOS in a Hackathon when I was 3rd year student, at that time, iOS version was 4.3.2. I wasn't interested at all in iOS development at that time because I loved Android. I shaped myself to be an Android developer and went Android internship and jobs at 2 big companies in Vietnam. 

Sometimes its not you who decide the job, sometimes the job chooses you. I had chance to work with Windows Phone and VoIP. I remembered being in the top Windows Phone askers on Stackoverflow, very active on pjsip and kamailio mailing list. I learned a lot because working in the low level means understanding more.

I always think that developer = reader on Stackoverflow + forker on Github + follower on Twitter + typist

You know the question I always ask people, even in interview is?
That is "What defines a good developer?"
I even searched online for the satisfactory answer to this question and disregarding all of them, I was always thought that "Algorithm defines good developer". Yeah, "good developer" not "developer". Having good algorithm mindset means more performance software, more professional, more productivity.

The chance took place when I applied for a mobile developer position in a new company. The interviewer asked me what platform I want to develop? This stroke me immediately because I was prepared to answer "Android developer", but I then asked myself "Am I a professional mobile developer?". I knew some of Windows Phone, some of Android, a bit of iOS and those "some" definitely don't make me a professional mobile developer. By "professional" I mean "knowing almost every nitty gritty detail" of the platform you're working at.

Some people advise to be a "full stack" developer. I'm definitely against this, how can you be good at everything? I think just "be best at one thing + know some of other things" is more practical. Well, at least for now

What would be more challenge than starting over with a platform you know least? So I picked iOS and decided to go professional with it since then. Its better for me. The WWDC 2014 Keynote is the first time I watch live

I'm very happy in the iOS community, it's very active and I learn lots of things



#### How I learnt iOS


I started with iOS as a newbie and this approach may be suitable for any newbie iOS developers

1. Learn the basic of the language, the project structure. Apple document is definitely the best to go, but you should read tutorials on other blogs first, because its more intuitive and practical

2. When you read a nice article, you should bookmark that article and that blog, too. Some people have good articles and you always keep an eye on them. You can use some bookmarking tools to help you. I use Chrome bookmarks :D Here are the resources I collect.

3. Do more projects. Getting your hand dirty means getting more experience

4. Always stay up to date. New iOS version is released every year, new good articles and tips are posted every week, everyday. So make sure you are aware of it. Watch WWDC and TechTalk early and carefully, be more active on Github, Twitter, Stackoverflow, Quora, follow the most inspiring people so you can get updated

[Most voted iOS questions on Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ios)

5. Relearn about OOP Programming principles, Refactoring techniques and how to write beautiful, clean code. Then learn design patterns and how Cocoa Touch framework adapts those patterns in iOS
[Recommended websites and books for OOP](http://www.fantageek.com/681/recommended-books-for-oop/)

6. Learn from most popular iOS libraries on Github and other open source projects

7. Learn how to be more productive by using libraries, tools and Xcode plugins
[Recommended iOS Toolbox](http://www.fantageek.com/1021/recommended-toolbox-for-ios/)

8. I'm kind of [Fear of missing out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) person, so I suggest you to always check for some other tech aggregation sites, such as [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), [Lobster](https://lobste.rs/), ... I even create my own [NSArticle](http://nsarticle.com/), you can check it out :)

9. Read some good iOS libraries out there to see how they structures their code and the approaches they take

10. Learn to do Unit Testing. The more you do, the more you love it

11. There are some good conferences out there. If you can't afford to go, you can watch the videos, if free :)
[Top 10 iOS Conferences in 2014](http://www.raywenderlich.com/63283/top-10-ios-conferences-2014)

12. Tweet more, create more useful projects on Github, ask more on Stackoverflow and write more blog articles. Someday you can write a book of your own

13. Learn from other platforms. Having good acknowledge of Android, Windows Phone, C, Ruby, ... can help you be creative with more idea. You can see how the Ruby community helps iOS in many ways
[Recommended websites for online learning](http://www.fantageek.com/1028/recommended-websites-for-online-learning/)

14. I don't care much about the language. Swift is new in WWDC 2014 and I learn it with no fear. The language is the way for you to learn new concept. Follow Code Complete 2 advice "You should program into Your Language. You shouldn't program in Your Language"



#### Attitude


1. Having good acknowledge of the SDK is not good enough, you have to learn how to learn, how to work more efficiently, and how to communicate well. You are not a single island, you are surrounded by many good guys and you have to take advantages of that, as well as to give back

2. I hate that when
- People tell thing no one want to hear
- People tell thing they don't actually understand
- People are selfish and afraid to share

I try to avoid those things

3. Always share and contribute to the community whenever possible
